# Bi-Encoder-Siamese-Networks-For-Word-Sense-Disambiguation

This repository contains the code for Word-Sense Disambiguation problem using Bi-Encoder Siamese networks. In our work, we have majorly used two models: DistilBert and Tiny-bert for encoders in Siamese Network. Detailed Information about complete work goes below in various sections.

## Word Sense Disambiguation

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the correct meaning (sense) of a word based on its context. Many words in natural language are polysemous â€” they have multiple meanings depending on usage. For example, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. WSD aims to resolve such ambiguities by assigning the most appropriate sense from a predefined inventory (like WordNet) or through contextual modeling. Accurate WSD is critical for improving machine understanding in applications such as machine translation, information retrieval, question answering, and semantic search.
